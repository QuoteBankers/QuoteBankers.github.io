# Imagine Jekyll Theme

Jekyll theme based on [Imagine Bootstrap Template](https://colorlib.com/wp/template/imagine/) under CC BY 3.0 license, which means [footer credits must remain in place](https://colorlib.com/wp/licence/).

I've changed the contents a bit to show more of what the template/theme can do.
