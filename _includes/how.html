        To choose the perfect subject is not enough to be quoted. And always having the same tone either. As we'll see in the next visualization, there is an interaction

      <h5 class = "text-black">Politics, which emotion to convince ? </h5>
      <p class = "mb-4">
        Politics is the topic for which emotions are the most balanced, compared to the other considered topics. The most used emotion in politics quotes
        is sadness. However the neutral tone is also frequetly used. Only joy seems not to be part of the politican arsenal to be quoted. That can be explained by several reasons: 
        first, according to Ivan Garibay in a paper published in May 2021, controversial informations spreads faster than non-controversial informations. And those informations 
        mainly rely on negative informations, which may explain why joy is the less quoted emotion for this topic.
        Also, the <i>politics</i> topic will also include more informative quotes which will likely end up in the more tamed emotions categories such as <i>calm</i>, <i>sad</i> or <i>neutral</i>.
