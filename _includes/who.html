          <b>Isn't it a pleasure to be listened to?</b> The ability to make your
          voice heard is a privilege that few can afford. Sometimes you can have
          the feeling that only the loudest are listened to. We have analyzed
          the Quotebank dataset from 2015 to 2020. From the Quotebank dataset we
          extracted information about the speakers from
          <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page">Wikidata</a
          >, let us see who are the most quoted speakers:

          From this picture we can see that we have a wide mixture of speakers.
          Unsurprisingly, the biggest names in the picture and the most quoted
          speakers are american politicians and other world leaders, but we can
          also see a lot of sports personalities, Bussiness leaders, artists and
          influencers. Let us now take a deeper dive into the data...

        As seen from the graph (log-scaled in the y-axis),
        <b>most quotes are made by a few people</b>, and
        <b>most people have made a few quotes</b>. In this dataset,
        <b>20% of the most quoted speakers have made 89% of the quotes</b>! The
        distribution of the number of quotes per speaker is a power law, and
        interestingly also follows the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">80/20 rule</a>,
        also known as the Pareto principle.
        <br />
        The Pareto principle was observed by the Italian economist Vilfredo
        Pareto, whom while at the University of Lausanne (!), showed that 80% of
        the land in Italy was owned by 20% of the population. This distribution
        has further been seen in other areas such as 80% of wealth is owned by
        20% of the population. 80% of all end users generally use only 20% of a
        software application's features, and 80% of health care resources are
        spent on 20 % of the patients. Now we find that 89% of quotes are made
        by 20% of quoted speakers.
        <br />
        &emsp;To answer the question <em>who has a voice in the media?</em>, we
        want to focus on people that are quoted regularly. A person that has
        only been quoted once does not really have "a voice in the media", and
        therefore going forward in our analysis, we will only consider speakers
        that have made more than 5 quotes.

          the years 2015-2020, we have not observed significant changes in the

        <p class="mb-4">
          Here we break down the speakers by gender and occupation. We can see
          that the overall most common occupation is politician, but when we
          break it down by gender we find that politician is actually not the
          most common occupation in any of the genders. We instead find that
          males lean towards sports, while women lean towards creative
          occupations such as actor, singer and writer. In order to reduce the
          complexity of the data and to more easily compare the occupations we
          decide on a fixed set of relevant occupation groups: politician,
          athlete, actor, lawyer, researcher, journalist, musician, and
          businessperson. We then use the lexical database
          <a href="https://wordnet.princeton.edu/">wordnet</a>
          to calculate similarities between each occupation and each occupation
          group and the add the occupation group as a new feature in the dataset
