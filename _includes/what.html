        Using a topic classification method, we were able to determine the most probable topic 
        for each quote. Overall, the three most talked about subjects are sport, art, and economy & finance.
        As the QuoteBank dataset was formed by collecting quotes from newspapers, this repartition of topics is nothing but expected.
        Indeed, sports and culture specialised newspapers are far more knowed by the general public than scientific publications journal for example.
        However, pure political subjects are not as predominant as one could have thought. To be able to analyse further how each group of people choose their subject to be quotes, 
        let us dig a level bellow and take interest in the clustering results.

        <h5 class= "text-black"> Politicians that don't talk about politics ? </h4>
        <p class = "mb-4">
          As seen in the overall analysis, and contrary to what could have been common sense, 
          politics is <b>not</b> the most talked subject of the politicians cluster ! 
          One specific reason may be explaining this oddity in our results. We can assume that 
          the model **add quotes**  has classified in the "Politics" topic only quotes
          that are centered on purely political subjects such as elections or nomination of member of governments.
          Therefore all the subjects about the impacts of politics on the economy or in healthcare for example will 
          be classified in their respective category. Hence, it is not suprising to notice that,
          appart for the <sub><i>elephant in room</i></sub> art topic, the three main subjects are economy, finance,
          and of course politics...

          <br/>
          Now let's talk about the aforementioned <i>elephant in the room</i>, the <b>Art</b> topic.
          Who could have expected that politicians are mainly interested in art ? Well..., they may be not. 
          Indeed, let's not forget that the cluster A is also populated by writers, singers, and actors, which are all deeply art-oriented 
          occupations.
        </p>
        <h5 class = "text-black">Artists and their things...</h5>
        <p class = "mb-4">
          Now that we have had a better understanding of the first cluster, let's analyse the second one.
          Like cluster A, cluster B is also populated by actors writers, singers and politicans, but this cluster has a younger age overall,
          and also is much less quoted. 
          Cluster B also countains much more <i>artists</i> than cluster A. All of these reasons may explain why, in this group, 
          more than <b>50%</b> of the quotes are classified as art. All the other topics results are tight together, around 7% for health, science and politics, and 15% for sport economy and finance.
        </p>
        <h5 class = "text-black">Everything for the sport ! </h5>
        <p class = "mb-4">
          Cluster C is made of young, fiery sportmen and sportwomen. And as we can see on the topic 
          classification results for this cluster, the big bulk of the quotes ( just above <b>50%</b>) 
          are about... Sports ! 
          In term of shear numbers, that makes it up to <b>21 millions</b> quotes about sport, 
          which is much higher than for the two other cluster.
          However, a non-negligible portion of the quotes were classified in <i>Art</i> and <i>Politics</i>. That may be explained
          that even if they are sportperson, everyone is prone to talk about those subjects.
          Finally, we see that the <i>Economy & Finance</i> topic is one of the less quoted subject for cluster C. 
          This is surely because it is very unlikely that a sportsperson will be asked a question about those two subjects during an interview
          or even talk about this subject in a relevant manner on the fly. The same thing could be said for health, but the fact that sport in highly related to health in general 
          may explain the small difference in percentage.
